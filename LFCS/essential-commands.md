### Login to Local, Remote Graphical and Text Mode:

SSH: Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. The best known example application is for remote login to computer systems by users.

Telnet: Telnet is a network protocol used on the Internet or local area networks to provide a bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication facility using a virtual terminal connection.

but SSH is more secure than Telnet because it uses encrypted communication.
`$ ip link` - is used to check the network interfaces.
`$ ip addr` - is used to check the IP address of the network interfaces.
`$ ssh username@ipaddress` - is used to login to the remote machine.
`$ telnet ipaddress` - is used to login to the remote machine.
`$ ip a` - is used to check the IP address of the network interfaces.
